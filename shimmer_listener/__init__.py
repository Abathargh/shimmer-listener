"""
This library allows you to connect to a Shimmer2/2r mote via Bluetooth both in Master and Slave
mode, interacting with the applications on the mote.

When communicating with a Shimmer mote using an app made with this library as the Bluetooth Master,
you have to implement the presentation protocol inside of the Shimmer nesC application. This protocol is a way
to inform the Bt Master about the data format used when sending messages.

The protocol is implemented by sending a simple struct via Bluetooth as the very first message after successfully
establishing a connection with the Bt Master. Its format is the following:

```c
typedef char key_string[MAX_STR_LEN];

typedef struct {
    uint8_t framesize;
    uint8_t chunklen;
    char format[MAX_FMT_LEN];
    key_string keys[MAX_KEY_NUM];
} frameinfo;
```

The presentation frame is automatically interpreted from the BtStream, so you don't have to do anything from this side
of the communication.
